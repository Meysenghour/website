        <p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) reported that Cambodia is one of the first ASEAN member countries to finalise its plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In contrast, it revealed that many other nations have yet to complete their plans, with some still in the proposal stage and others without any plan in place.</p>
        <p>The bank’s 2024 report on climate in the Asia-Pacific region stated that Cambodia has developed a comprehensive and clear plan focusing on four main areas.</p>
        <p>These include measures for all emission scopes covered by the target; expected emission reductions from these measures within a specified time period; the extent of measure implementation; and a schedule for regular reviews, as outlined in the Net Zero Tracker.</p>
        <p>Ministry of Environment spokesperson Khvay Atiya highlighted that Cambodia has set clear targets for carbon neutrality by 2050, outlining a long-term carbon-neutral development strategy and updating the national plan for participation in the implementation of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p>
        <p>“Cambodia has achieved these milestones due to the precise, smart and proactive leadership of Prime Minister Hun Manet. The leadership of the Cambodian government has enhanced national pride, social harmony, prosperity, development and the well-being of the Cambodian people under the umbrella of peace and comprehensive development,” he said.</p>
        <p>The ministry noted that the government has put forth the Pentagonal Strategy-Phase 1 aimed at economic growth, job creation, equity assurance, increased efficiency and sustainability to fulfil the aspirations of the people and realise the country’s 2050 vision.</p>
        <p>As part of this strategy, the prime minister has directed the ministry to develop the Circular Strategy on Environment 2023-2028 to prioritise and guide efforts toward a clean, green and sustainable Cambodia.</p>
        <p>Regarding climate-related issues, environment minister Eang Sophalleth, representing the prime minister, led a high-level delegation back to Cambodia on November 2 after attending the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) to the UN Convention on Biological Diversity in Cali, Colombia from October 26.</p>
        <p>The minister stated that the summit continued discussions on policies and action plans focused on fostering harmony between humans and nature and further enhancing human-nature relationships.</p>
        <p>Sophalleth added that achieving this requires each member country to protect, conserve and expand biodiversity, ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources to support the livelihoods of communities living in protected areas.</p>
        <p>“Another key objective of this meeting was to mobilise funds for the conservation, protection and expansion of biodiversity management areas, particularly in support of developing countries,” he said.</p>
        <p>In his address to nearly 200 world leaders, the minister highlighted phase one of the government’s Pentagonal Strategy, highlighting the introduction of the environment strategy and other national action plans related to biodiversity management and conservation.</p>
        <p>Additionally, Sophalleth noted the government's commitment to ongoing actions, such as expanding forest cover through the planting of at least one million trees annually, distributing saplings to citizens for free and establishing nurseries to increase tree planting nationwide.</p>
        <p>The minister stated, “What the environment ministry is currently doing aligns with the goals of the UN, which is to protect and conserve natural resources while ensuring harmonious coexistence between people and nature.”</p>
        <p>He added that the country’s achievements in preserving and expanding biodiversity and natural resources have earned national recognition on the international stage, showcasing the country’s efforts to promote a clean, green and biodiversity-rich world.</p>
        <p>He said these efforts align with the UN’s 2030 Agenda and Cambodia’s 2050 vision.</p>
        <p>During the conference, the Cambodian delegation also strengthened and expanded cooperation with the host country and 12 other participating nations, as well as with the UN and various development partners, according to the ministry.</p>
